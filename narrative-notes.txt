Make it centered more on the pilot, the main character.

Give it narration, make the pilot removed from the combat because he is. (this saves time doing voice acting for other characters)

"
We've started a war with a powerful enemy,
One with a weapon so powerful it's destroyed my entire home planet,
My family, my friends, all gone, in an instant,
I didn't even get to say goodbye,

The attack is simply, while my friends are fighting and dying out in deep space,
distracting the enemy,
My job is to sneak in and fight my way to the core of the space station
AND DESTROY IT
If I'm fast enough to outrun the blast, I'll survive
...if not, well, at least I'll see my family again.

I'm doing this for all the people that I've lost
